# timeseriesinfinance
Time series data are data that are indexed by a sequence of dates or times. I show how to use methods built into Pandas to work with this index. Also,  see how resample time series to change the frequency and how to calculate rolling and cumulative values for times series. Finally, I'll use all my knowledge to build a value-weighted stock index from actual stock data.
